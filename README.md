# Weather App using Streamlit and OpenWeatherMap API

This project is a simple weather application built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). It allows users to check the current weather conditions for any city by entering the city name.

### Features:
- Displays current weather data, including:
  - Temperature (in Â°C)
  - Weather description (e.g., Clear sky, Rain, etc.)
  - Humidity percentage
  - Wind speed (in m/s)
- Real-time weather information fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Simple and user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
- Hosted on Google Colab with public access via `ngrok` for easy testing and deployment.

### Prerequisites:
To run the app, you need the following:
- Python 3.x
- An OpenWeatherMap API key (you can obtain one [here](https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up))
- The following Python packages:
  - Streamlit
  - Requests
  - pyngrok (if running on Colab for tunneling)

### How to Run the App Locally:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-app.git
   cd weather-app
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   You can install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Add Your OpenWeatherMap API Key:**

   Open `weather_app.py` and replace the placeholder `API_KEY` with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap:

   ```python
   API_KEY = "your_openweathermap_api_key"
   ```

4. **Run the App with Streamlit:**

   Use Streamlit to run the app locally:

   ```bash
   streamlit run weather_app.py
   ```

5. **Access the App:**

   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to use the app.

### How to Run in Google Colab:
If you prefer running the app on Google Colab, you can follow these steps:

1. **Open your Colab Notebook** and install the necessary libraries:

   ```python
   !pip install streamlit pyngrok
   ```

2. **Add your ngrok authtoken** for tunneling:

   ```python
   !ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN
   ```

3. **Run the Streamlit app:**

   Once your ngrok setup is complete, execute the provided Python code for running Streamlit and exposing the app to a public URL.

4. **Click on the public URL** generated by ngrok to access your Streamlit weather app.

### Example Usage:

1. Enter the name of the city.
2. Get real-time weather details, including temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed.

### Screenshots:
_Add screenshots of your weather app interface here._

### Technologies Used:
- **Streamlit**: For building the web interface.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: For fetching real-time weather data.
- **Requests Library**: To send HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **ngrok**: For exposing the app to the public in Google Colab.
